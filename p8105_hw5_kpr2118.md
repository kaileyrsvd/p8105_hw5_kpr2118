```

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

#### Data Description:

The homicide data provided by the Washington Post is information on over
52,000 criminal homicides in 50 large U.S. cities over the past decade.
It contains variables that describe the date and location of the
killing, if there was an arrest made (or not), basic demographics about
the victim (first and last name, race, age, sex).

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"), 
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved", 
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved", 
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
      )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Take a closer look….

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
    group_by(city_state) %>% 
    summarize(
      hom_total = n(), 
      hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Single city prop test…

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Iterate…

``` r
results_df =
  aggregate_df %>% 
    mutate(
      prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)), 
      tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
    ) %>% 
    select(-prop_tests) %>% 
    unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
    select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Plot estimates and CIs for each city…. organized by proportion of
unsolved homicides…

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Import data

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("data/lda_data"), 
  ) %>% 
    mutate(
      path = str_c("data/lda_data/", path), 
      data = map(path, read_csv))
```
